 * This is very simple to use but has the drawback of the overhead having to
 * call these two functions for every loop.
 *
 * This is suitable for trivial apps where you roll your event system
 * using select() or poll().
 *
 * See for example smb2-cat-async.c for an example on how to use these
 * two functions in an event loop.

 * should call smb2_service_fd() with fd = -1 when the timeout is reached.
 * This will trigger a new socket connection on the next resolved address. All
